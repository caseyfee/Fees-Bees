# How to Use Shifa

Here are  step-by-step instructions for using the Shifa website features.

## How to Sign into Shifa
New User:
1. If it the user's first time, they must sign up using the sign up link. Upon creating a patient profile, the user is sent to a simple form where basic medical information is collected.

2. Once the medical information is collected, the user is sent to an appointment link where they can choose a 30 or 60 minute initial appointment.

3. Once an indivudal chooses a time that works for them, they are sent a confirmation email with reminder potentials.

4. At this point, a user profile will have been created where the user can see what they responded in the form. As many users create profiles and fill out the basic medical history forms, a database is created of folks who could use medical assistance and their ailments that doctors and medical professionals can connect to. 

Existing User:
1. Once an existing user logs in, they are directed to their profile page that lists the user's most recent answers to the medical forms.

2. An existing user can create as many appointment requests as they want so doctors can connect with them. 

# Troubleshooting

Contact our team at our GitHub profiles for technical assistance.

# Next Steps:
* Ensure application is as accessible as possible
* Create a doctor portal that would pull all potential patient's information so doctors can review and choose to connect with patients one on one.
  To do this, we would restructure our models (which we started) to have an umbrella "users" where "medicalProfessionals" and "Patients" live under
*
